# Air-quality-Data-analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Air Quality Data to study pollution trends, regional variations, and correlations between different pollutants. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

## Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

## Key Task
Collected, cleaned, and analyzed air quality datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Performed trend analysis, correlation study, and outlier detection to assess pollution levels.
Built visualizations and insights to evaluate factors

## Insights

Seasonal patterns and time-based pollution fluctuations were observed.

Certain regions showed consistently higher pollutant levels compared to others.

Correlation analysis revealed strong relationships between specific pollutants.

## Outcome
This project provided clear insights into air quality variations, helping understand pollution patterns and their potential causes. The visualizations make it easier to interpret the data and can support decision-making in environmental studies.
