# Air-quality-Data-analysis

##Project Overview##

This project focuses on analyzing Air Quality Data to study pollution trends, regional variations, and correlations between different pollutants. Using Python, I performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

##Tools & Libraries##
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib

##Key Tasks##
Collected, cleaned, and analyzed air quality datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Performed trend analysis, correlation study, and outlier detection to assess pollution levels.
Built visualizations and insights to evaluate factors
